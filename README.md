# CivSimulator

In a distant future, Skynet eradicated the human specie. John Connor and the other rebels failed their mission. The world is now dominated by the machines. However, Skynet has trouble maintaining his authority and dissolved in factions autonomous and independent. This factions are leaded by artificial intelligences less evolved than Skynet, but they have their own free will. They are fighting merciless against each other for the domination of the world.
